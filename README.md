# Him ❤️

Tinder is not fair game when you are a man. Even if you spend a lot of money in Boosts, you won't get 50+ matches per day like women do.

That's until you use `Him`.

`Him` is here to re-establish genders equality on Tinder.

## Features

- Like profiles depending on your configuration
- Send the first message based on a list
- Chat with your matches using [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com) `text-davinci-003` trained especialy for Tinder
- Detect phone numbers in conversations and add your match to a whitelist, so you can take the lead
- Bumble feature is in progress...

**_NOTE:_**  `Him` works very very well! So well, that sometimes it books me so many dates at the same night I don't know what to do with it... So please be repectful while using it. It's just here to help you with your dates, that's it. Don't upset people with it! Thanks!
